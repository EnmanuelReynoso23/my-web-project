# Random History Generator

This project implements a random history generator in Python using a Jupyter notebook. The generator creates fictional historical events based on predefined structures and randomization techniques.

## Overview

The Random History Generator is designed to produce a series of random historical events that can be used for storytelling, game development, or educational purposes. The notebook includes sections for importing necessary libraries, defining data structures, generating random events, creating a timeline of history, and displaying the results.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/random_history_generator.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the random history generator.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the required Python libraries for running the notebook.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter notebook, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries for random number generation and data manipulation (listed in `requirements.txt`).

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required libraries by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook notebooks/random_history_generator.ipynb
   ```
5. Run the cells in the notebook to generate random historical events.

## Additional Information

Feel free to modify the data structures and event generation logic to create unique historical narratives. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
